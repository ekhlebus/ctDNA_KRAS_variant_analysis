# Targeted ctDNA Variant Analysis in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

## Project overview
This repository contains a reproducible bioinformatics workflow for analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing data from a single metastatic colorectal cancer patient, based on the study:
[Circulating tumor DNA sequencing in colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line chemotherapy with anti-EGFR](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95345-4)

Raw sequencing data were obtained from NCBI BioProject **PRJNA714799**.  
The analysis focuses on targeted sequencing of a clinically relevant gene (**KRAS**) and compares variant profiles **pre-treatment vs during/post-treatment**.

Why ctDNA? Short Half-Life: ctDNA is cleared from the blood quickly (hours), making its levels highly responsive to changes in the tumor. Analysis of the plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a **non-invasive** alternative to classical tissue-based analysis for tumor specific genetic alterationsю

## Scientific Question
How does the mutational profile of a clinically relevant gene (KRAS) in ctDNA change between pre-treatment and post-treatment time points, and how does this align with known resistance mechanisms to anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer?
